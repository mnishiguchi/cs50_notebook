/*--------------------my answer ----------------------------------------------

        The spell-check section of speller.c keeps on reading one character 
        each from a file. It ensures that a scanned character is an 
        alphabetical character or, unless being the first letter of a word,
        apostrophe. Then it stores the character in character array word[index]
        and update index for next character to be stored.

        There are two conditions that make the word invalid:

            - If index exceeds LENGTH (= 45), the character string is not an
            English word given the fact 45 is the longest of English words.
            Therefore we proceed to next word by consuming remainder of
            alphabetical string and resetting index.
            - If text includes numbers, it can be considered as invalid.
            Therefore we move on to following word by eating up remaining 
            alphanumeric string and zeroing index.

        When a scanned character is NOT an alphabetical one nor apostrophe, 
        index greater than zero means that we have found a whole word with
        length the index indicates. 
        
        To finish off with a current whole word, we add a null-terminater to
        it, then update word counter.
