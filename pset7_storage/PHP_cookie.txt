Even though HTTP is a "stateless" protocol, whereby browsers are supposed to
disconnect from servers as soon as they’re done downloading pages,
"cookies" allow browsers to remind servers who they or, really, you are on subsequent requests for content.

PHP uses "session cookies" to provide you with $_SESSION, an associative array
in which you can store any data to which you’d like to have access for the duration of some user’s visit.

The moment a user ends his or her "session" (i.e., visit) by quitting his or her browser,
the contents of $_SESSION are lost for that user specifically
because the next time that user visits, he or she will be assigned a new cookie!
